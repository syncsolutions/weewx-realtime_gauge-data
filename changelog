v0.2.8
*   Reworked day max/min calculations to better handle missing historical data. 
    If historical max/min data is missing day max/min will default to the 
    current value for the obs concerned.
v0.2.7
*   loop packets are now cached to support partial loop packet stations
*   windSpeed obtained from archive is now only handled as a ValueTuple to
    avoid units issues
v0.2.6
*   updated docstring config options to reflect current library of available
    options
*   'latest' and 'avgbearing' wind directions now return the last non-None
    wind direction respectively when their feeder direction is None
*   implemented optional scroller_text config option allowing fixed scroller
    text to be specified in lieu of Zambretti forecast text
*   renamed rtgd thread and queue variables
*   no longer reads unit group config options that have only one possible unit
*   use of mmHg, knot or cm units reverts to hPa, mile_per_hour and mm
    respectively due to weeWX or SteelSeries Gauges not understanding the unit
    (or derived unit)
*   made gauge-data.txt unit code determination more robust
*   reworked code that formats gauge-data.txt field data to better handle None
    values
v0.2.5
*   fixed error where altitude units could not be changed from meter
*   rainrate and windrun unit groups are now derived from rain and speed units
    groups respectively
*   solar calc config options no longer searched for in [StdWXCalculate]
v0.2.4
*   fixed error where rain units could not be changed form mm
*   pressures now formats to correct number of decimal places
*   reworked temp and pressure trend formatting
v0.2.3
*   Fixed logic error in windrose calculations.
*   Minor tweaking of windrose processing.
v0.2.2
*   Added config option apptemp_binding specifying a binding containing appTemp
    data. apptempTL and apptempTH default to apptemp if binding not specified
    or it does not contain appTemp data.
*   added missing mile string format to installer
v0.2.1
*   fixed error that resulted in incorrect pressL and pressH values
v0.2
*   now runs in a thread to eliminate blocking impact on weewx
*   now calculates WindRoseData
*   now calculates pressL and pressH
*   frequency of generation is now specified by a single config option
    min_interval
*   gauge-data.txt output path is now specified by rtgd_path config option
*   added config options for windrose period and number of compass points to
    be generated

v0.1.2
*   fix error that occurred when stations do not emit radiation

v0.1.1
*   better handle loop observations that are None

v0.1
*   initial release
